# Algorithm Practice

A repository for HackerRank and CodeSignal algorithms to be planned,
practiced, solved, and refactored for effeciency between projects.

While mainly focusing on HackerRank's 30 Days Of Code, this repo
also contains challenges from elsewhere on the site as well as the occasional
algorithm from CodeSignal.
